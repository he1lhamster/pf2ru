    <b>Source</b> [[source/39|Advanced Player's Guide]] <br/><i>You command powerful magic, not through study or
    devotion to any ideal, but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely
    understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient
    spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone
    else. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit,
    though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan.</i><br/><br/><b>Key
    Ability: INTELLIGENCE</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.<br/><br/><b>Hit
    Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level

            <b>[[trait/324|Hex]]</b>: A hex is a short-term effect generated on the fly from your patron's magic,
            requiring your familiar to draw from your patron. As such, you can cast only one spell with the hex trait
            each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell on the same turn fail and the spellcasting actions are
            lost.<br/><br/><b>[[trait/107|Metamagic]]</b>: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your
            spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before
            Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than
            Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by
            a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.</p>

        A witch's patron is a mysterious entity, rarely known or understood even by the witch in that patron's service. The nature of the relationship between a witch and their patron can serve as details for character development and storytelling. When playing a witch, work with
        your GM to determine the nature of your patron and how much of that nature you know, both as a player and a
        character. There are countless ways to handle a witch's patron; the following are just a few approaches you
        might take.<br/><br/> For a character who truly doesn't know their patron, you might have your GM choose your
        patron's theme and which lessons your witch learns, as the patron determines what powers to bestow upon you as
        their emissary—and these can provide clues to your patron's nature. You could instead give your GM a list of
        lessons you'd like for your character and let the GM choose between them, representing a negotiation between
        your witch and the patron. In this case, you might choose your patron's theme to indicate which aspect of the
        patron relates to your character, or let your GM choose the theme. If you want to be fully in control of your
        abilities, you can choose the lessons you most prefer and let the GM tailor the identity of your patron
        accordingly.<br/><br/> Another approach is for you to craft the details of your witch's patron yourself. You can
        then provide those details to the GM to incorporate into a larger narrative or to provide additional flavor and
        roleplaying context for your character. Your character might still remain ignorant of that patron's identity,
        even if you as a player know it. Perhaps your character knows the nature of their patron but is cursed to never
        reveal it to others. You might have willingly sworn a pact to your patron but fear the repercussions should
        others learn of that pact. Or perhaps you and your patron are entirely forthcoming about your relationship.<br/><br/>
        Every witch is different, and no story is wrong so long as it's fun and engaging for everyone involved!</p></div>

    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Witch</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use

    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety

    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever
    array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through its own

    your familiar to learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might
    seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community.<br/>

        <li>Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides.
        </li>
        <li>View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its
            personality.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that
            you unknowingly serve to a foul power.
        </li>
        <li>Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering
            their adversaries.
        </li>
        <li>Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered.</li>

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the class features you gain at 1st level, you have
    the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training, noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Patron</h2>You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years in
    devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has chosen you as
    their vessel to carry forth some agenda in the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing
    little of their identity and motivations, and they grant you spells and other magical powers through a familiar,
    which serves as a conduit for their power.<br/><br/> A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of powerful hags,
    a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working in tandem. As you
    gain more of your patron's power, you might learn more about who or what they are—certain combinations of themes and
    lessons suggest particular patrons or agendas—but patrons empower witches for their own secretive reasons, which
    they rarely reveal in full.<br/><br/> At 1st level, choose your patron's theme, which determines your spellcasting
    tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you gain, and a spell added to your familiar. The patron themes can be found
    here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Familiar</h2>Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you and
    facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the rules here, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your
    patron, it's more powerful than other familiars. Your familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another
    extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br/><br/> Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your
    patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your
    witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-level spells, and one additional spell
    determined by your patron's theme. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by
    your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.<br/><br/> Each time you gain a level, your
    patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen from common spells of your tradition
    or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.<br/><br/> Your familiar can
    learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically
    consuming a scroll of that spell in a process that takes 1 hour. You can use the [[action/25|Learn a Spell]]
    exploration activity to prepare a special written version of a spell, which your familiar can consume as if it were
    a scroll. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another
    witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your
    spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an
    offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.<br/><br/> If your
    familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or
    reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar
    knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Witch Spellcasting</h2>Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to
    cast spells. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal
    components when casting spells.<br/><br/> At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips
    each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or
    until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.<br/><br/> As
    you increase in level as a witch, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell
    slots increase, as shown in Table 2–7: Witch Spells per Day.<br/><br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a
    spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by
    attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your
    Intelligence modifier. <h3 class="h3-header">Heightening Spells</h3> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and
    higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level,
    heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain
    levels. <h3 class="h3-header">Cantrips</h3>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell
    that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is
    automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of witch spell
    slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your
    cantrips are 3rd-level spells.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Hexes</h2>Your patron and familiar teach you special spells called hexes. A hex is a
    short-term effect drawn directly from your patron's magic. As such, you can cast only one hex each turn; attempts to
    cast a second hex spell on that turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.<br/><br/> Hexes are a type of focus
    spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill
    your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the
    Refocus activity to commune with your familiar. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded
    up. <br/><br/>Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can
    give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than
    3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. <br/><br/>You learn the [[spell/804|phase familiar]]
    hex, which you can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm. You learn most other hexes from witch
    lessons. <h3 class="h3-header">Hex Cantrips</h3> Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you
    can cast them as often as you like, though you can still cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition
    to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex
    cantrips are determined by your patron theme.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the
    corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Witch Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>

    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to
    increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in
    one skill in which you're already trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
    your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
    increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>

    magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack.
    Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You

    <h2 class="h2-header">Patron's Gift<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 19</span>
    </h2>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot
    and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots
    can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more
    spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the [[feat/1591|Patron's
    Truth]] feat to gain a second slot.<br/>
