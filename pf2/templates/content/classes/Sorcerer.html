    <b>Source</b> [[source/1|Core Rulebook]] <br/><i>You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one.
    There’s magic in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with a primal
    creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your
    inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however,
    and you constantly face the choice of whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into
    destruction.</i><br/><br/><b>Key Ability: CHARISMA</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to
    Charisma.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum number of HP
    by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.<br/>

        <div class="sidebar-header">Key Terms</div>
        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see the following term in many sorcerer class features. <br/><br/><b>[[trait/107|Metamagic]]</b>:
            These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want
            to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly
            after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the
            spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.</div>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Sorcerer</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds,
    and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you
    abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is powerful, to conserve your best spells—or when
    you’ve used them all up—you also rely on cantrips.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with
    people.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your
    adventuring group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you
    try to solve them.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">In Downtime...</h2>You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to
    research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">You Might...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to
            distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.
        </li>
        <li>View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to
            vehement rejection.
        </li>
        <li>Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and
            mistrust.
        </li>
        <li>Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other practitioners of magic, since
            power comes to you naturally.
        </li>
        <li>Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Initial Proficiencies</h1>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following
    statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other
    way.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Perception</h2>Trained in Perception<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Saving Throws</h2>Trained in Fortitude<br/>Trained in Reflex<br/>Expert in Will<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skills</h2>Trained in one or more skills determined by your bloodline<br/>Trained in a number
    of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Attacks</h2>Trained in simple weapons<br/>Trained in unarmed attacks<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Defenses</h2>Untrained in all armor<br/>Trained in unarmored defense<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Spells</h2>Trained in spell attack rolls of your spellcasting tradition, as indicated by your
    bloodline<br/>Trained in spell DCs of your spellcasting tradition, as indicated by your bloodline<br/>

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Bloodline</h2>Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice
    determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and
    additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The
    bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.<br/><br/> Bloodlines can be found here<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can
    cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when
    casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with
    somatic components, so you don't need to use a [[equipment/33|material component pouch]].<br/><br/> Each day, you
    can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell
    repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br/><br/> As you
    increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you
    can cast, as shown on Table 3–17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.<br/><br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a
    spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by
    attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your
    Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.<h3 class="h3-header">
    Heightening Spells</h3>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger
    versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in
    your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific
    improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten
    certain spells freely.<h3 class="h3-header">Cantrips</h3>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special
    type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip
    is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of sorcerer
    spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level
    sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Spell Repertoire</h2>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At
    1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional
    spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to
    your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your
    spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.<br/><br/> You add to this spell repertoire as
    you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–17), you add a spell of the same level to your
    spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by
    your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level,
    you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might
    select a higher-level version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that
    spell.<br/><br/> Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are
    separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot,
    and vice versa. <h3 class="h3-header">Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3> As you gain new spells in your spell
    repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and
    learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be
    a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the
    skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Sorcerer Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter
    5.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Signature Spells<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span></h2>You’ve
    learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that
    level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
    you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
    can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
    can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can
    also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any
    spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become
    trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already
    trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you’re
    already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you’re already a
    master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Magical Fortitude<span class="item-type"
                                                 style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>Magical
    power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.<br/>

    inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and
    spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Lightning Reflexes<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>Your
    reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Alertness<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>
    You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>Training
    and magic improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to
    expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Defensive Robes<span class="item-type"
                                               style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>The flow of
    magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in
    unarmored defense increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You’ve
    learned to inflict grave wounds with your practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed
    attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Master Spellcaster<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span></h2>You have

    perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You
    gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other
    spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let
    you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the
    [[feat/631|Bloodline Perfection]] sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Legendary Spellcaster<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 19</span></h2>You
