    <b>Source</b> [[source/39|Advanced Player's Guide]] <br/><i>Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or
    cumbersome weapons. For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among
    combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all
    while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets
    you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.</i><br/><br/><b>Key Ability:
    DEXTERITY</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points: 10 plus
    your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every
    level thereafter.<br/>

        <div class="sidebar-header">Key Terms</div>
        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities.
            <br/><br/><b>[[trait/322|Finisher]]</b>: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache.
            You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a
            finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the [[trait/15|attack]] trait for the
            rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on
            a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply
            the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.
            <br/><br/>[[trait/73|Flourish]]: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much
            exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
            <br/><br/><b>[[trait/152|Stance]]</b>: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an
            action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get
            knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a
            new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one
            for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.</p>

    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Swashbuckler</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build
    up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while
    dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance
    among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both.
    You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always
    prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes
    rather than skulking to avoid detection.<br/>

    train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name
    or establish a following of admirers.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">You Might...</h2>
    <ul>

            present.
        </li>
        <li>Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.</li>
        <li>Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.</li>
        <li>Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.</li>
        <li>Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.</li>

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Panache</h2>You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually
    accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment
    of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a
    state of panache or you are not.<br/><br/> You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated
    with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including [[action/29|Tumble Through]] and additional actions
    determined by your swashbuckler's style. At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a
    particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if
    your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).<br/><br/>
    While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to
    Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also
    causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident
    Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. <br/><br/>Normally, you gain
    and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Swashbuckler's Style</h2>As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables
    you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This
    style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that
    action. <br/><br/>A list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Precise Strike</h2>You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile
    or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is
    part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.<br/><br/> As your swashbuckler level
    increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike
    and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Confident Finisher</h2>You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have
    panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=550, name="Confident Finisher") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Swashbuckler Feats</h2>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler
    class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the
    corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Great Fortitude<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>Your physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves
    increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Opportune Riposte<span class="item-type"
                                                 style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span></h2>You turn
    the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the Opportune Riposte reaction.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=551, name="Opportune Riposte") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this either to increase your
    proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
    which you're already trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your
    proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
    increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Stylish Tricks<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for [[skill/1|Acrobatics]] or
    the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Vivacious Speed<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>When you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible
    speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus
    increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status
    bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>You've
    dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial
    weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all
    weapons for which you have expert proficiency.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Evasion<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>
    You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex
    saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>You've
    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're
    legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Exemplary Finisher<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>You
    execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make
    as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your
    swashbuckler's style. <br/><br/>A list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Swashbuckler Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                      style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>You
    perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for
    your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Continuous Flair<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>While not
    equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you
    succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance
    bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration
    changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Vigilant Senses<span class="item-type"
                                               style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>Through your

    ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a
    critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a
    damaging effect, you take half damage.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Light Armor Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You've
    learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense
    increase to expert.<br/>

    </h2>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an
