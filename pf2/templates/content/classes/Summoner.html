<b>Source</b> [[source/96|Secrets of Magic]] <br/><i>You can magically beckon a powerful being called an eidolon to your
    side, serving as the mortal conduit that anchors it to the world. Whether your eidolon is a friend, a servant, or
    even a personal god, your connection to it marks you as extraordinary, shaping the course of your life
    dramatically</i><br/><br/><b>Key Ability: CHARISMA</b>
<br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution

    <div class="sidebar-header">Key Terms</div>
    <p class="sidebar--p">The following key terms can be found in many summoner class
    features.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/386|Eidolon]]</b>: A creature with this trait is an eidolon. An action or spell with
    this trait can be performed by an eidolon only. An item with this trait can be used or worn by an eidolon only, and
    an eidolon can't use items that don't have this trait. (An eidolon can have up to two items invested.)<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/394|Evolution]]</b>:
    Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.<br/><br/>
    <b>[[trait/395|Tandem]]</b>: Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a
    tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't Manifested your Eidolon, or if you've
    Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the Meld into Eidolon feat). Tandem
    actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you
        and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.</p>

    <div class="box-simple-header">Summoning Spells</div>
    <p>When the [[feat/2912|Master Summoner]], [[feat/2913|Ostentatious
    Arrival]], and [[feat/2943|Legendary Summoner]] feats refer to summoning spells, they mean spells that conjure a
    creature with the summoned trait. The spells that qualify from the <i>Core Rulebook</i> and this book are
    [[spell/1004|summon anarch]], [[spell/316|summon animal]], [[spell/1006|summon axiom]], [[spell/320|summon
    elemental]], [[spell/321|summon entity]], [[spell/322|summon fey]], [[spell/323|summon fiend]], [[spell/1010|summon
    lesser servitor]], and [[spell/325|summon plant or fungus]]. Your GM might add other spells from future books that
        work like these spells.</p>

</table><h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry And
    Background</h2>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">Initial
    Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">
    Eidolon</h2>You have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting below). Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features. Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before. You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.

<div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=759, name="Share Senses") }}</div><h3 class="h3-header">Gear And Your
    Eidolon</h3> Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the [[trait/386|eidolon]] trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.
<ul>
    <li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>
    <li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's [[equipment/278|armor potency rune]] or
        [[equipment/416|bracers of armor]]. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the
        [[equipment/279|resilient]] rune on your armor or from your <i>bracers of armor</i>. Other permanent items that
        grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.
    </li>
    <li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your [[equipment/441|handwraps of
        mighty blows]]. Alternatively, you can [[action/289|Invest]] a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't
        normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits
        only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time.
        In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations
        noted in <i>handwraps of mighty blows</i>.
    </li>
</ul> <h3 class="h3-header">Lost And Altered
    Actions</h3> If you or your eidolon becomes [[condition/35|slowed]], [[condition/36|stunned]], [[condition/32|quickened]], or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were slowed 1, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became [[condition/24|immobilized]] or [[condition/30|petrified]], it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.
<br/>
<br/> You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the [[condition/5|confused]] or [[condition/6|controlled]] condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">Summoner
    Spellcasting</h2>Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a [[equipment/33|material component pouch]].
<br/>
<br/> Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.
<br/>
<br/> As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.
<br/>
<br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Roll.
<h3 class="h3-header">Heightening
    Spells</h3> When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.
<h3 class="h3-header">
    Cantrips</h3> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">Spell
    Repertoire</h2>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.
<br/>
<br/> You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.
<br/>
<br/> At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.
<h3 class="h3-header">Swapping Spells in Your
    Repertoire</h3> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.
<br/>
<br/>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">Link
    Spells</h2>Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.
<br/>
<br/> Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here.
<br/>
<br/> You learn the [[spell/1047|evolution surge]] link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits.
<h3 class="h3-header">Link
    Cantrips</h3> Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.
<br/>
<br/>You learn the [[spell/1045|boost eidolon]] link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">Evolution
    Feat</h2>Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link. You gain an evolution feat for your eidolon at 1st level, representing the differences that make it unique from other eidolons of its type. If you retrain this feat, the feat you replace it with must also be an evolution feat.
<br/><h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type">Level 2</span>
</h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
