    <b>Source</b> [[source/1|Core Rulebook]] <br/><i>Deities work their will upon the world in infinite ways, and you

    spells might protect and heal your allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills.
    Yours is a life of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed.</i><br/><br/><b>Key

        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see the following term in many cleric class features. <br/><br/><b>[[trait/107|Metamagic]]</b>:
            These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want
            to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly
            after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the
            spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.</p></div>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Cleric</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>If you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and
    attacking with weapons— typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily
    cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra
    spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive
    speeches. Because you’re wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come
    across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or
    hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.<br/>

    deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.<br/>

    <ul>
        <li>Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other
            worshippers of your deity.
        </li>
        <li>Know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.</li>
        <li>Cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it.</li>
        <li>Expect you to heal their wounds.</li>
        <li>Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.</li>

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training, noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Deity</h2>As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. The
    most common deities in Pathfinder are found here, along with their alignments, areas of concern, and the benefits
    you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their
    entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the
    favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.<br/><br/> Your deity also adds spells to your spell
    list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of
    their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you
    prepare them this way.<br/><br/>A list of all deities can be found here.<h3 class="h3-header">Anathema</h3>Acts
    fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells,
    committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.<br/><br/>
    Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is likewise
    anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities, and casting lawful spells
    is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity isn't limited this way, but their
    alignment might change over time if they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain alignment.
    Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your
    connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to [[deity/14|Pharasma]],
    the goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.<br/><br/> If you
    perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity,
    you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are
    determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be
    regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an [[ritual/2|atone]] ritual.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Divine Spellcasting</h2>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can
    cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when
    casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a
    [[equipment/41|religious symbol]]) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a
    [[equipment/33|material component pouch]]. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each
    morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access.
    Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of
    spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.<br/><br/> As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of
    spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–9:
    Cleric Spells per Day on page 120.<br/><br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see
    how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw).
    Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on
    calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls. <h3 class="h3-header">Heightening Spells</h3> When you
    get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This
    increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when
    they are heightened to certain levels. <h3 class="h3-header">Cantrips</h3> A cantrip is a special type of spell that
    doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always
    automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of cleric spell
    slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric,
    your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Divine Font</h2>Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either
    the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day,
    you can prepare additional [[spell/148|heal]] or [[spell/146|harm]] spells, depending on your deity. The divine font
    spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose
    between <i>heal</i> or <i>harm</i>. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or
    divine intervention.<br/><br/><b>Healing Font</b>: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of
    cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <i>heal</i> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1
    plus your Charisma modifier.<br/><br/><b>Harmful Font</b>: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest
    level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <i>harm</i> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is
    equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Doctrine</h2>Even among followers of the same deity, there are numerous doctrines and beliefs,
    which sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first
    doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial
    benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine’s
    second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.<br/><br/>Doctrines can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Cleric Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
    have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter
    5.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either
    become trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you’re already
    trained.<br/><br/> You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a
    skill in which you’re already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become
    legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Alertness<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>
    You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Resolve<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>
    You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
    success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Lightning Reflexes<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>Your
    reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Divine Defense<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span>
    </h2>Your training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to
    expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You’ve
    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re
    legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Miraculous Spell<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 19</span></h2>You're
    exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a
    spell in that slot using divine spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells
    without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level
    up, though you can take the [[feat/309|Maker of Miracles]] feat to gain a second slot.<br/>
