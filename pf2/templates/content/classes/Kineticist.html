    <div class="sidebar">
        <div class="sidebar-header">Key Terms</div>
        <p class="sidebar--p">The following new key traits appear in many kineticist class features and feats.<br/><br/>
            <b>[[trait/501|Composite]]</b>: A composite impulse combines multiple elements. You can gain an
            [[trait/502|impulse]] with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed
            in the impulse's traits. <br/><br/><b>[[trait/502|Impulse]]</b>: The primary magical actions kineticists use
            are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element,
            and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the
            [[trait/32|concentrate]] trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an
            element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.<br/><br/>
            <b>[[trait/503|Infusion]]</b>: Actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. You must use
            an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. If you use any action (including
            free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the
            infusion action. Any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of
            the infusion action itself.<br/><br/> [[trait/506|Overflow]]: Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the
            energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura
            deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [[action/2124|Channel Elements]]). Extinguishing your
            element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if
            you reactivate your kinetic gate.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/152|Stance]]</b>: A stance is a general combat
            strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait and that you remain in for some time. A
            stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter
            ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait,
           you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.</p>

       <div class="box-simple-header">Special Rules</div>
       <p>Some rules don't come up that often but can be vital to
        understand when they do.<br/><br/> <b>Made of an Element</b>: Some kineticist abilities work on creatures made
        of an element. A creature made of rock, sand, or dirt is made of earth, but a creature wearing metal armor
        wouldn't be considered a metal creature. If it's unclear whether a creature is made of an element, the GM
        decides.<br/><br/> <b>Overlapping Kinetic Auras</b>: A creature that's in multiple kinetic auras at the same
        time is subject to the special effects of all of them. As normal for duplicate effects, a creature can't be
        affected by multiple copies of the same effect. For instance, if an enemy were in two fire kineticists' auras,
        and both kineticists had the fire kinetic aura gate junction, the creature would gain only the higher weakness
        from the two auras.<br/><br/> <b>Precious Materials</b>: Elements you create (using Base Kinesis to generate an
        element, for example) must typically be ordinary materials of negligible value. You can't create precious or
        valuable materials like [[equipment/277|silver]], gemstones, or [[equipment/273|duskwood]] unless otherwise
          noted.</p>

    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Kineticist</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>Elemental magic surges from you throughout the fight. Without
    any restrictions on how often you can use your abilities, you become a reliable slinger of magic. You can develop
    powers you can use in a variety of situations... or you can choose just a few favorite attacks you use
    repeatedly.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>The elements you channel might guide or even influence how you
    carry yourself in social situations. You might leap to anger like a raging fire stand your ground as solid as a
    mountain, keep your motives elusive as the wind, go with the flow like water, make cutting remarks sharp as metal,
    or exhibit the slow patience of the forest.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>Your innate connection to the elements hones your awareness of the
    natural world. In an environment full of an element you can channel, you're unparalleled, with the ability to
    repeatedly manipulate the element around you.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">In Downtime...</h2>You could commune with the elements or practice your control over your
    kineticist powers. Through retraining, you can realign the flow of your kinetic gate to perfect different
    manifestations of your element.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">You Might...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a conflicted relationship with the kinetic gate that fuels your kineticist magic, possibly because it
            manifested at a traumatic point in your past.
        </li>
        <li>Struggle with controlling and understanding your elemental powers.</li>
        <li>Form a kinship with elemental creatures or feel at home in areas strong with your element.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Find your ability to keep calling on more and more elemental power truly astonishing.</li>
        <li>Defer to you in all matters related to your element, from the smallest tasks to the politics of the
            elemental planes.
        </li>
        <li>Worry you'll consume yourself with elemental magic or lose control of its primal forces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry And Background</h2>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have
    the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Attribute Boosts</h2>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four
    free boosts to different attribute modifiers.<br/><br/> At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
    free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts
    to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by
    1.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Kinetic Gate</h2>As a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural
    conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. You can choose either
    a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.<br/><br/> When selecting an element for your
    kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements—air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are
    referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally
    wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could
    create air in a vacuum.<br/><br/> Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and
    control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as
    described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets
    you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements. <h3 class="h3-header">Single
    Gate</h3> Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you
    greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that
    have that element's trait.<br/><br/> In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use
    an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse,
    unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Air</b> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or
            Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.
        </li>
        <li><b>Earth</b> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start
            of your next turn.
        </li>
        <li><b>Fire</b> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</li>
        <li><b>Metal</b> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature
            touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon, it takes damage of the
            chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).
        </li>
        <li><b>Water</b> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its
            area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the
            air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or
            that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.
        </li>
        <li><b>Wood</b> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3-header">Dual Gate</h3> Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to
    combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements.
    Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the
    other.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Kinetic Aura</h2>Through your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit
    your person. The form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. Examples include a chaotic wind
    orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame, stars of raw metal always changing shape,
    floating snowflakes, or splinters dancing in the air. If you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your
    kinetic elements appear in the aura.<br/><br/> You have the Channel Elements action, which lets you activate your
    kinetic aura.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=2124, name="Channel Elements") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Impulses</h2>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing
    them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your
    kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the [[trait/502|impulse]] trait. You automatically gain
    the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats.
    You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more
    with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic
    elements.<br/><br/> Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect
    impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect
    against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells)
    also apply to impulses. <h3 class="h3-header">Impulse Levels</h3> Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For
    instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank),
    even though you gained the action at 1st level.<br/><br/> Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you
    increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more “Level” entries. This either lists the levels
    at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a
    regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a “Level (+4)” entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and
    17th levels. <h3 class="h3-header">Impulse Attacks And DCs</h3> An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your
    kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <b>impulse attack roll</b> to see how effective
    they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC.
    Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier
    + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your
    class DC. The drained condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a
    [[equipment/2654|gate attenuator]] to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier. <h3 class="h3-header">Elemental
    Blast</h3> The Elemental Blast impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure
    matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to
    using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different
    form each time you use the impulse.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=2125, name="Elemental Blast") }}</div>
    <h3 class="h3-header">Base Kinesis</h3> The Base Kinesis impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=2126, name="Base Kinesis") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Kineticist Feats</h2>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a kineticist class
    feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the

    <h2 class="h2-header">Extract Element<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>Creatures with a strong tie to your element might be troublesome for you to deal with, at least until you've
    learned to turn their elemental nature to your advantage. You gain the Extract Element action.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=2127, name="Extract Elements") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either
    become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already
    trained.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already
    an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Will Expertise<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>Your mental defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Gate's Threshold<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>You reach a
    new milestone in your odyssey to become in tune with your kinetic gate and must decide how to expand the gate's
    power. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose to either expand the portal or fork the path.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Expand the Portal</b>: Your gate attunes more precisely to one of your elements. Gain an impulse feat of
            your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a
            [[trait/501|composite]] impulse. You also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. If you have
            no valid options for the feat—typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to
            gaining that element's impulses—you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for
            which you meet the prerequisites.
        </li>
        <li><b>Fork the Path</b>: Your gate reaches to another elemental plane. Add a new element of your choice to your
            kinetic elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower with the trait of that element. You can't
            select a composite impulse feat with this feat selection.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3-header">Gate Junctions</h3> When you gain a gate junction, you develop a specialized kinetic
    technique. Choose one benefit from the gate junction table for one of your kinetic elements.
    <ul>
        <li>A <b>critical blast</b> junction happens when you get a critical success with an Elemental Blast of the
            kinetic element.
        </li>
        <li>An <b>elemental resistance</b> grants you resistance to damage while your kinetic aura is active. This
            resistance is equal to your level, and it applies to damage of any listed type or that comes from a creature
            or effect that has any of the listed traits. At 17th level, you gain immunity to effects with any of the
            listed traits. This doesn't make you immune to creatures with such a trait. You can voluntarily forgo this
            resistance, immunity, or both if you want an effect to work on you.
        </li>
        <li>You can choose an <b>impulse junction</b> instead of one of the listed junctions. Impulse junctions are
            listed under Single Gate class feature above.
        </li>
        <li>An <b>aura junction</b> adds an effect to your kinetic aura when you Channel Elements.</li>
        <li>A <b>skill junction</b> makes you trained in the listed skill and grants you the listed skill feat. If you
            were already trained in the listed skill, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. While your
            kinetic aura is active, you gain a +1 status bonus to the listed skill; the bonus increases to +2 at 10th
            level and +3 at 17th level.
        </li>
    </ul>
    You can select each gate junction only once, unless noted otherwise, but you can have the same type of junction for
    multiple elements. You can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. If you have
    multiple junctions that would apply at the same time— such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements—you can
    apply any number of them. (Though note that you can use only one impulse junction per round.)<br/><br/>See here for
    all gate junctions by element<br/>

    sustenance of your inner gate counters harm that would come to your body. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves
    increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>

    kinetic gate grows stronger, making your elements harder to resist. The power flowing from you is even harder to
    resist. Your proficiency rank for your kineticist class DC increases to expert.<br/>

    one of the impulses you've learned into a different but still similar magic. When you make your daily preparations,
    you can replace one of your [[trait/502|impulse]] feats with a different impulse feat that has the same elemental
    trait. You can reflow only impulse feats that have exactly one elemental trait, not composite impulse feats or feats
    that vary by element. This follows the same rules as retraining; you can replace impulse feats gained through your
    class feats or through class features that grant you impulse feats.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>You've

    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're
    legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Greater Kinetic Durability<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span>
    </h2>Your gate protects you even more. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you
    roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Fortitude save against an
    effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Kinetic Mastery<span class="item-type"

    <h2 class="h2-header">Double Reflow<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 17</span>

    instead of one.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Final Gate<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 19</span>
    </h2>Your kinetic gate reaches a perfect form, its power constantly fighting to be released. If your kinetic aura is
    inactive, you automatically use the first action of your turn to [[action/2124|Channel Elements]] as a free action.
    You can deliberately suppress the effect. If you're unable to act, final gate still functions, but you don't get to
    use the [[action/2125|Elemental Blast]] or stance impulse you normally do from using Channel Elements.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Kinetic Legend<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 19</span>
