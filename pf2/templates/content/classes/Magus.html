        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see the following key term in many magus class features.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/152|Stance]]</b>:
            A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you
            remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if
            any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After
            you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a
            stance only in encounter mode.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bordered-box">
        <div class="box-simple-header">Combining your Abilities</div>
        <p>As a magus, you have multiple special actions and
        abilities that can be used in combination with your spells. You can enter your Arcane Cascade stance with either
        Spellstrike or a normally cast spell, so it could be in your best interest to cast a spell to buff yourself at
        the beginning of a fight and enter Arcane Cascade, rather than going for an early Spellstrike. You can usually
        stay in Arcane Cascade for a long time, though if you find out an enemy has a weakness to a certain damage type,
        such as fire, you might want to refresh your stance with a fire spell to take advantage of the bonus damage.
        It's often worth it to cast your conflux spells and make a Strike either on a turn where you can't make a
        Spellstrike, or as the last action on your turn after a Spellstrike. Sometimes, it might be worth it to cast a
        conflux spell even if you think you'll miss, because it can still recharge your Spellstrike for your next turn.
        Since a lot can ride on your Spellstrike, which uses your multiple attack penalty, it's much better if used as
        the first attack of the turn!

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry And Background</h2>In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have
    the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Arcane Spellcasting</h2>You study spells so you can combine them with your attacks or solve
    problems that strength of arms alone can't handle. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and
    you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw
    replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing
    them with somatic components instead of needing a [[equipment/33|material component pouch]].<br/><br/> At 1st level,
    you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below).
    Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of
    spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.<br/><br/> As you increase in level as a magus, your number of
    spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2–2: Magus Spells
    per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two
    spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower
    than your highest spell level.<br/><br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how
    effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your
    spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in
    Spell Attack Roll. <h3 class="h3-header">Heightening Spells</h3> When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher,
    you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening
    it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels. <h3
        class="h3-header">Cantrips</h3> A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast
    a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level
    rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level
    magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. <h3
        class="h3-header">Spellbook</h3> Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You
    start with a [[equipment/53|spellbook]] worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare
    your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells.
    You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to.
    Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled
    <i>Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare</i> to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your
    name scrawled on the cover.<br/><br/> Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook,
    of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the [[skill/2|Arcana]] skill to add other spells that you find
    in your adventures (see Learn a Spell). Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep
    the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-level slots as normal.<br/><br/> If you have a
    spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the [[feat/742|Wizard Dedication]] feat), you can use
    the same spellbook for all your spells.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Spellstrike</h2>You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical
    and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=755, name="Spellstrike") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Spellstrike Specifics</h2> Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various
    modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack. <br/><br/><b>One
    Target</b>: The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats
    let you affect more creatures. <br/><br/><b>Reach</b>: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the
    weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, [[spell/283|shocking grasp]] would affect a
    creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with [[trait/192|reach]], and [[spell/245|ray of frost]]
    would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer. <br/><br/><b>Ancillary
    Effects</b>: Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as
    well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, [[spell/3|acid splash]]
    would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and [[spell/330|tanglefoot]]'s circumstance
    penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has
    other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell. <br/><br/><b>Multiple
    Defenses</b>: Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save
    attempted by the target of a [[spell/76|disintegrate]] spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it
    again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later
    ones.<br/><br/> <b>Invalid or Immune Target</b>: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the
    spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it
    can still be affected by the spell.<br/><br/> <b>Variable Actions</b>: Some spells have different effects based on
    the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of
    the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take <i>exactly</i> 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike
    with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.<br/><br/> <b>Metamagic</b>: You typically
    can't use [[trait/107|metamagic]] with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a
    Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Arcane Cascade</h2>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks
    more effective.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=756, name="Arcane Cascade") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Hybrid Study</h2>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a
    unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to
    represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to
    Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. Hybrid Studies can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Conflux Spells</h2>You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast
    additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat
    and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1
    Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending
    10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.<br/><br/> Focus
    spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can
    you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus
    pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Magus Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the

    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this skill increase to
    become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you are already
    trained.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already
    an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels

                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>Your

    dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial
    weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Studious Spells<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span>
    </h2>Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special
    2nd-level studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare [[spell/299|spider climb]], [[spell/345|true strike]],
    [[spell/370|water breathing]], and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this
    class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add
    [[spell/147|haste]] and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase
    to 4th level and you add [[spell/125|fly]] and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.<br/><br/>See
    specific hybrid studies for more information.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>You can
    inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in
    which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.<br/>

                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>Your

    attacks increase to master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Greater Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span>
    </h2>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an
    expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Juggernaut<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span>

    extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell
    slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same
    spell again without expending a spell slot.<br/><br/> If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or
    you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.<br/>
