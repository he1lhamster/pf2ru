    <b>Source</b> [[source/1|Core Rulebook]] <br/><i>The power of nature is impossible to resist. It can bring ruin to
    the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them
    beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking
    splendor to those who respect it— and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who
    hear nature’s call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its
    service.</i><br/><br/><b>Key Ability: WISDOM</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to
    Wisdom.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum number of HP by
    this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.<br/>

        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see the following term in many druid class features. <br/><br/><b>[[trait/107|Metamagic]]</b>:
            These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want
            to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly
            after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the
            spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.</p></div>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Druid</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and
    protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their
    wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon
    powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems,
    looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live
    in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they
    can’t have all that they desire.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the
    wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their
    extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">In Downtime...</h2>You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature
    might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You
    might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land
    without harming the natural balance.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">You Might...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.</li>
        <li>Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon
            it.
        </li>
        <li>Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it.</li>
        <li>Assume you’re a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild.</li>
        <li>Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Initial Proficiencies</h1>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following
    statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Primal Spellcasting</h2>The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal
    spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting
    spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and
    mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a [[equipment/33|material component
    pouch]].<br/><br/> At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common
    spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain
    available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is
    called your spell slots.<br/><br/> As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each
    day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–11: Druid Spells per
    Day.<br/><br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have
    your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom,
    your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in
    Spell Attack Rolls. <h3 class="h3-header">Heightening Spells</h3> When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher,
    you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening
    it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. <h3
        class="h3-header">Cantrips</h3> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that
    doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically
    heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have.
    For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are
    3rd-level spells.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Anathema</h2>As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you
    perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class,
    including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you
    demonstrate your repentance by conducting an [[ritual/2|atone]] ritual.<br/><br/> The following acts are anathema to
    all druids:
    <ul>
        <li>Using metal armor or shields.</li>
        <li>Despoiling natural places.</li>
        <li>Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.</li>
    </ul>
    Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order’s entry.<br/><br/>See specific orders
    for more information.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Druidic Language</h2>You know Druidic, a secret language known to only druids, in addition to
    any languages you know through your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the Druidic language to
    non-druids is anathema.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Druidic Order</h2>Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants
    you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll
    always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in
    search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of
    different orders.<br/><br/> Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell,
    and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you
    can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or
    otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.<br/><br/> Focus spells are automatically heightened
    to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't
    cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your
    focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells are found
    here.<br/><br/>Orders can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Shield Block</h2>You gain the [[feat/839|Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction that lets you
    reduce damage with your shield.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Wild Empathy</h2>You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you
    to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make
    very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Druid Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a druid class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the
    skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Alertness<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span></h2>
    Experience has made you increasingly aware of threats around you, and you react more quickly to danger. Your
    proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter
    5.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Great Fortitude<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to
    increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in
    one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
    your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
    increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Lightning Reflexes<span class="item-type"

    command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. Your proficiency ranks for primal spell attack rolls
    and spell DCs increase to expert.<br/>

    </h2>You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
    and unarmored defense increase to expert.<br/>

                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You’ve
    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re
    legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Master Spellcaster<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span></h2>Primal

    command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single
    10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using primal spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot
    for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. You don't
    gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the [[feat/353|Hierophant's Power]] feat to gain a
    second slot.<br/>
