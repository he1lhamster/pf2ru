    You might use your powers to become a charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator,
    scholar, scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne’erdo- well and a

        <div class="sidebar-header">Key Terms</div>
        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see the following key terms in many bard class
        features.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/31|Composition]]</b>: To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you use a
        type of [[skill/12|Performance]]. If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an
        [[trait/16|auditory]] performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a [[trait/163|visual]]
        one. The spell gains all the traits of the performance you used. You can cast only one composition spell each
        turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from
        your previous composition spell end immediately.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/107|Metamagic]]</b>: Actions with the
        metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must
        use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including
        free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic
        action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic
        action itself.

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Occult Spellcasting</h2>You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can cast occult
    spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting
    spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a bard, you can usually play an instrument for spells requiring somatic
    or material components, as long as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use an instrument, you don't
    need a [[equipment/33|material component pouch]] or another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument for
    spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.<br/><br/>Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells.
    You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells
    you can cast each day is called your spell slots.<br/><br/> As you increase in level as a bard, your number of
    spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3–6: Bard Spells per
    Day<br/><br/> Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have
    your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is
    Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics
    are found under Spell Attack Rolls. <h3 class="h3-header">Heightening Spells</h3> When you get spell slots of 2nd
    level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's
    level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order
    to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The
    signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. <h3 class="h3-header">Cantrips</h3> Some of
    your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip
    at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is
    usually equal to the highest level of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are
    1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Spell Repertoire</h2>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At
    1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose
    these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast
    any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.<br/><br/> You add to this
    spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–6), you add a spell to your
    spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two
    2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have,
    so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.<br/><br/> Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell
    slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell
    repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. <h3 class="h3-header">Swapping Spells in Your
    Repertoire</h3> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you
    previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a
    different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during
    downtime.<br/>

    <h2 class="h2-header">Composition Spells</h2>You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects
    called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill
    when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and
    you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can
    regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or
    otherwise engage your muse.<br/><br/> Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much
    like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can
    give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than
    3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells are found here.<br/><br/> You learn the [[spell/381|counter
    performance]] composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects.<h3 class="h3-header">Composition
    Cantrips</h3> Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them
    as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list.
    Generally, only feats can give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition
    cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn
    the [[spell/386|inspire courage]] composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense
    against fear.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Muses</h2>As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things,
    and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.<br/><br/>Muses can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Bard Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span></h2>
    At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
    have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter
    5.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Lightning Reflexes<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span></h2>Your
    reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Signature Spells<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span></h2>Experience
    allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that
    level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
    you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
    can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
    can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can
    also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any
    spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to
    increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in
    one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
    your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
    increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter. The list of feats is in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Expert Spellcaster<span class="item-type"

    You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
    success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Bard Weapon Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>You
    have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks,
    plus the [[weapon/31|longsword]], [[weapon/36|rapier]], [[weapon/37|sap]], [[weapon/77|shortbow]],
    [[weapon/43|shortsword]], and [[weapon/48|whip]]. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these
    weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect
    for that weapon or unarmed attack.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Vigilant Senses<span class="item-type"
                                               style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>Through your

    learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense
    increase to expert.<br/>

                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You’ve
    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you’re a master, and 4 damage
    if you’re legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Master Spellcaster<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span></h2>You’ve

    <h2 class="h2-header">Magnum Opus<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 19</span>
    </h2>You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your
    repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using bard
    spellcasting. You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use
    10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell
    slots.<br/>
