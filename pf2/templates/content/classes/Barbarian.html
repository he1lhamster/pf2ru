<div class="class-content">
    <b>Source</b> [[source/1|Core Rulebook]] <br/><i>Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and
    using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated
    techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a
    spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail,
    whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters
    most.</i><br/><br/><b>Key Ability: STRENGTH</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Strength.<br/><br/><b>Hit
    Points: 12 plus your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st
    level and every level thereafter.<br/>

        You'll see the following key terms in many barbarian class
        features.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/73|Flourish]]</b>: Flourish actions are techniques that require too much exertion
        to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/123|Open]]</b>:
        These maneuvers work only as your first salvo on your turn. You can use an open action only if you haven't used
        an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/135|Rage]]</b>: You must be
        [[action/3|raging]] to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.

    <h1 class="h1-header">Roleplaying the Barbarian</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Combat Encounters...</h2>You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your
    way through. Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low
    defenses.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when
    gentler persuasion can’t get the job done.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">While Exploring...</h2>You look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an
    instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky
    currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water’s surface. If something needs breaking, you’re up to the task!<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">In Downtime...</h2>You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your
    mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">You Might...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.</li>
        <li>Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.</li>
        <li>Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness—and punch anyone who says this conflicts with your distaste
            for patience and tedium.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Others Probably...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight.</li>
        <li>See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.</li>
        <li>Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Initial Proficiencies</h1>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following
    statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other
    way.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Perception</h2>Expert in Perception<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Saving Throws</h2>Expert in Fortitude<br/>Trained in Reflex<br/>Expert in Will<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skills</h2>Trained in [[skill/3|Athletics]]<br/>Trained in a number of additional skills equal
    to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier
    <br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Attacks</h2>Trained in simple weapons<br/>Trained in martial weapons<br/>Trained in unarmed
    attacks<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Defenses</h2>Trained in light armor<br/>Trained in medium armor<br/>Trained in unarmored
    defense<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Class DC</h2>Trained in barbarian class DC<br/>
    <h1 class="h1-header">Class Features</h1>You gain these features as a Barbarian. Abilities gained at higher levels

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted in at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Rage</h2>You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=3, name="Rage") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Instinct</h2>Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you learned from a tradition or
    that comes naturally to you. Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain behaviors, grants you
    increased damage and resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your instinct. <br/><br/>Instincts
    can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Barbarian Feats</h2>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a
    barbarian class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the
    skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Deny Advantage<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures
    of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help
    their allies flank.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter
    5.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to
    increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in
    one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
    your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
    increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Brutality<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>
    Your fury makes your weapons lethal. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks
    increase to expert. While raging, you gain access to the critical specialization effects for melee weapons and
    unarmed attacks.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Juggernaut<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>
    Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves
    increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>Your
    rage helps you hit harder. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you have expert
    proficiency. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. You gain your instinct’s
    specialization ability.<br/><br/>See specific instincts for more information.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Lightning Reflexes<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>Your
    reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br/>

                                                 style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>Repeated
    exposure and toughened skin allow you to fend off harm. While raging, you gain resistance equal to 3 + your
    Constitution modifier to damage types based on your instinct.<br/><br/>See specific instincts for more
    information.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Mighty Rage<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span>
    </h2>Your rage intensifies and lets you burst into action. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC
    increases to expert. You gain the Mighty Rage free action.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=4, name="Mighty Rage") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Greater Juggernaut<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>You have
    a stalwart physiology. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical
    failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an
    effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Medium Armor Expertise<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span>
    </h2>You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
    and unarmored defense increase to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Fury<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span>
    </h2>Your rage makes you even more effective with the weapons you wield. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons,
    martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Greater Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span>
    </h2>The weapons you’ve mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization
    increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re
    legendary. You gain a greater benefit from your instinct’s specialization ability.<br/><br/>See specific instincts
    for more information.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Indomitable Will<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span></h2>Your rage
    makes it difficult to control you. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success
    on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>

                                                 style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 17</span></h2>Your
    instinct heightens each of your senses further. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.<br/>

    </h2>You recover from your Rage quickly, and are soon ready to begin anew. After you spend a full turn without
    raging, you can Rage again without needing to wait 1 minute.<br/>

    unparalleled. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC increases to master. Your melee Strikes ignore 10
    points of a creature’s resistance to their physical damage.<br/>
