        <b>[[trait/405|Gadget]]</b>: Gadgets are consumable technological inventions
        with innovative uses.<br/><br/>
        <b>[[trait/410|Modification]]</b>: An ability with this trait alters your innovation's
        construction. If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain these feats more easily.<br/><br/>
        <b>[[trait/416|Unstable]]</b>: Unstable actions use experimental applications of your innovation that even you can't
        fully predict, and that are hazardous to your innovation (and potentially you). When you take an unstable
        action, attempt a DC 17 flat check immediately after applying its effects. On a failure, the innovation
        malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it
        becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of
        fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation
        and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that
        innovation again.<br/><br/> To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing
        an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are
        taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs
        to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the
        damage instead of you.<br/><br/> Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the
        unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you're unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action
        normally, but you can't use the unstable function.</p>

    fight; you seek to collect valuable data that can be used to improve your creations!<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">During Social Encounters...</h2>You provide useful context when discussing a variety of
    academic topics, particularly when speaking about those subjects related to crafting and invention. You might often

    crafting and meticulous attention to detail. You might also modify previous inventions to adjust for data you've
    collected in the field. You might work as a local smith or tinker where your skills are needed, or you might keep a
    workshop on the edge of town where the clank and clatter of your experiments attracts less attention.<br/>

    <ul>
        <li>Enjoy creating new things the world has never seen before.</li>

            probably record the results to try again later.
        </li>
        <li>Wear clothes spattered with oil and grime, or venture off on excited and technical tangents when asked

    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to what you gain from your chosen class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Overdrive</h2>You have a bevy of smaller devices of your own invention, from muscle stimulants
    to concussive pistons. When it's necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you in combat.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=901, name="Overdrive") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Innovation</h2>While you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your
    preeminent work, the one that you hope—with refinement—might change the world. Choose one innovation. Your
    innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and
    attempt a [[skill/4|Crafting]] check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only
    works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price. <br/><br/>Innovations can
    be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Explode</h2>Your innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always
    on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond
    its design specifications using special [[trait/416|unstable]] actions. <br/><br/>While inventors can learn various
    unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.
    <div class="viewbox">{{ viewbox(type="action", id=902, name="Explode") }}</div>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Peerless Inventor</h2>You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is
    unimpeachable. You gain the [[feat/798|Inventor]] skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Shield Block</h2>You gain the [[feat/839|Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction that lets you
    reduce damage with your shield.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Inventor Feats</h2>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an inventor class
    feat. Some features and feats use an assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For simplicity, these are left
    abstract, but if you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features,
    subject to GM discretion.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the
    corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Expert Overdrive<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span></h2>You've
    increased your skill in crafting, and you can put your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You become
    an expert in [[skill/4|Crafting]], and on a successful use of Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by
    1.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Reconfigure<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>You've become an expert in all crafts and are always adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change the
    modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a
    [[skill/4|Crafting]] check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you can change one modification you've
    chosen for your innovation to a different modification of the same kind (initial, breakthrough, or
    revolutionary).<br/><br/> If you have any [[trait/410|modification]] feats, on a successful check you can choose to
    instead retrain a modification feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to meet the standard
    restrictions for retraining.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either
    become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already
    trained.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already
    an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability
    boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or
    above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Inventor Weapon Expertise<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>You develop tricks for using your weapons more effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial
    weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. If you have a [[inventorinnovation/3|weapon innovation]], you gain
    access to the critical specialization effect with your innovation.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Breakthrough Innovation<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span>
    </h2>You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation.
    Choose a breakthrough modification of your innovation's type to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial
    modification of your innovation's type instead if you prefer.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Lightning Reflexes<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>Your
    reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Master Overdrive<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>Your mastery
    of invention and crafting enhances your Overdrive even further. You become a master in [[skill/4|Crafting]], and on
    a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 2, replacing the increase from expert
    overdrive.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>You've
    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're
    legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Inventive Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                   style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>Through
    innovation and experimentation, you've made your inventions more effective and reliable. Your proficiency rank for
    your inventor class DC increases to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Offensive Boost<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span>
    </h2>You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. Your improvements make any
    Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional 1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you choose.
    If your innovation is [[inventorinnovation/1|armor]], the boost applies to your melee unarmed Strikes and to your
    melee Strikes with one weapon you choose during daily preparations; if your innovation is a
    [[inventorinnovation/2|construct]], the boost applies to your construct companion's Strikes; and if your innovation
    is a [[inventorinnovation/3|weapon]], the boost applies to your Strikes with your innovation. You can spend downtime
    to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts,
    with the damage type in parentheses.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chill (Cold)</b>: Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.</li>
        <li><b>Ignition (Fire)</b>: Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.</li>
        <li><b>Jolt (Electricity)</b>: Your innovation jolts foes with charges of electricity.</li>
        <li><b>Momentum (Bludgeoning)</b>: Your innovation slams into foes with added momentum.</li>
        <li><b>Saws (Slashing)</b>: Your innovation reveals spinning sawblades during your attacks.</li>
        <li><b>Spike (Piercing)</b>: Your innovation reveals wicked spikes during your attacks.</li>
        <li><b>Vitriol (Acid)</b>: Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Medium Armor Expertise<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span>
    </h2>You've learned to better defend yourself against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
    and unarmored defense increase to expert.<br/><br/> If you have a medium or heavy armor innovation, you gain access
    to the critical specialization effect with your armor innovation.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Resolve<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 11</span></h2>
    You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
    success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Alertness<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span></h2>
    Your attention to detail lets you remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases
    to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Complete Reconfiguration<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span>
    </h2>When it comes to crafting and tinkering, you've become incredibly adept at changing your modifications to
    adjust your innovation's functionality. When you spend downtime to reconfigure your innovation and succeed at your
    [[skill/4|Crafting]] check, you can swap any number of modifications, swap your offensive boost, or retrain any
    number of [[trait/410|modification]] feats, rather than one. You still must swap a modification only with one of the
    same type (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Inventor Weapon Mastery<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 13</span>
    </h2>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks
    increase to master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Greater Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span>
    </h2>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an
    expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Legendary Overdrive<span class="item-type"
                                                   style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span></h2>Your
    peerless inventing and [[skill/4|Crafting]] ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in
    Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase
    from master overdrive.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Revolutionary Innovation<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 15</span>
    </h2>You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field—or at
    least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can
    also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Inventive Mastery<span class="item-type"
                                                 style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 17</span></h2>Your
    inventions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Juggernaut<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 17</span>
    </h2>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude

    ability to adjust your innovation has reached impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make major
    adjustments in your spare time. During your daily preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it's
    destroyed or [[condition/2|broken]], and you can change to a different innovation ([[inventorinnovation/1|armor]],
    [[inventorinnovation/2|construct]], [[inventorinnovation/3|weapon]], or other type you have access to) and change
    your modifications and offensive boost.<br/><br/> If you have any feats that had your previous innovation as a
    prerequisite, you can't use them until you retrain the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of downtime
