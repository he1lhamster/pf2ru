    <b>Source</b> [[source/1|Core Rulebook]] <br/><i>You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up
    a weighty mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around you. While champions exist for
    every alignment, as a champion of good, you provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses
    that you share freely with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of
    evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey.</i><br/><br/><b>Key
    Ability: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of
    Strength or Dexterity.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum
    number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.<br/>

        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see these terms in many champion abilities.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/73|Flourish]]</b>:
            Flourishes are techniques that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use
            only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/107|Metamagic]]</b>: These actions
            tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If
            you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste
            the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect,
            not of the metamagic action.<br/><br/> <b>[[trait/119|Oath]]</b>: Oaths add an additional tenet to your
            code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait.</p></div>

    </table>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry and Background</h2>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
    you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Initial Proficiencies</h2>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your
    basic training, noted at the start of this class.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Champion's Code</h2>You follow a code of conduct, beginning with tenets shared by all
    champions of an alignment (such as good), and continuing with tenets of your cause. Deities often add additional
    strictures (for instance, [[deity/18|Torag’s]] champions can’t show mercy to enemies of their people, making it
    almost impossible for them to follow the [[championcause/2|redeemer]] cause). Tenets are listed in order of
    importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a no-win
    situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you’re
    hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than
    preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to
    override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting
    authorities) is a violation of the champion code.<br/><br/> If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of
    conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an
    [[ritual/2|atone]] ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don’t require those class features. If
    your alignment shifts but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let you retrain your cause while still
    following the same deity.<br/><br/>Tenets can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Deity and Cause</h2>Champions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a deity to follow; your
    alignment must be one allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals or
    alignment are anathema to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be considered anathema appear in each
    deity’s entry. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema. You have one of the following causes. Your
    cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion’s reaction, grants you a devotion
    spell, and defines part of your champion’s code.<br/><br/>Causes can be found here.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Deific Weapon</h2>You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s uncommon, you gain
    access to it. If it’s an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step
    (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Champion's Reaction</h2>Your cause gives you a special reaction. See specific causes for more
    information.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Devotion Spells</h2>Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion
    spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus
    pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by
    spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.<br/><br/>
    Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus
    spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The
    full rules are found here. You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell
    attack rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Champion Feats</h2>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a champion
    class feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Shield Block</h2>You gain the [[feat/839|Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction that lets you
    reduce damage with your shield.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 2</span>
    </h2>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
    have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Divine Ally<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be
    changed.<br/><br/> The following are divine allies: <br/><br/><b>Blade Ally</b>: A spirit of battle dwells within
    your armaments. Select one weapon or [[equipment/441|handwraps of mighty blows]] when you make your daily
    preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune and you also gain the weapon's critical
    specialization effect. For a champion following the [[championtenet/1|tenets of good]], choose <i>[[equipment/294|disrupting]]</i>,
    <i>[[equipment/297|ghost touch]]</i>, <i>[[equipment/301|returning]]</i>, or <i>[[equipment/302|shifting]]</i>. For
    a champion following the [[championtenet/2|tenets of evil]], choose [[equipment/731|fearsome]], <i>returning</i>, or
    <i>shifting</i>.<br/><br/><b>Shield Ally</b>: A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the
    shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half. <br/><br/><b>Steed Ally</b>: You gain a young
    animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a
    [[animalcompanion/6|horse]]. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't
    grant it the mount special ability.
    <br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">General Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter
    5.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Skill Increases<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 3</span>
    </h2>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to
    increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in
    one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.<br/><br/> At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
    your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
    increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ability Boosts<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to
    increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
    if it starts out below 18.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Ancestry Feats<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span>
    </h2>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
    thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 5</span></h2>You’ve
    dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial
    weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Armor Expertise<span class="item-type" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span>
    </h2>You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency
    ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor
    specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Weapon Specialization<span class="item-type"
                                                     style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 7</span></h2>You’ve
    learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
    and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re
    legendary.<br/>
    <h2 class="h2-header">Champion Expertise<span class="item-type"
                                                  style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Level 9</span></h2>Prayers
    strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC and divine spell attack rolls and
    DCs increase to expert.<br/>

    </h2>Your champion’s reaction improves.<br/><br/>See specific causes for more information.<br/>
