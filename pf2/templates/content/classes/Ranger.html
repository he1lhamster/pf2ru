    <b>Source</b> [[source/1|Core Rulebook]] <br/><i>Some rangers believe civilization wears down the soul, but still
    needs to be protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame
    its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or
    hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off
    the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.</i><br/><br/><b>Key
    Ability: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</b><br/>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of
    Strength or Dexterity.<br/><br/><b>Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier</b><br/>You increase your maximum
    number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.<br/>
    <div class="sidebar-nofloat"><h2>Warden Spells</h2>Your relationship with the world around you extends from the
        physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you warden spells, which are a type of focus spells. It costs 1
        Focus Point (FP) to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1
        FP. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 FP by spending 10 minutes using
        the [[action/71|Refocus]] activity to commune with nature.<br/><br/> Your warden spells are primal spells. When
        you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in primal spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting
        ability is Wisdom. <br/><br/>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking
        feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never
        hold more than 3 FP. The full rules for focus spells appear here.

        <div class="sidebar-header">Key Terms</div>
        <p class="sidebar--p">You'll see these key terms in many ranger class features. <br/><br/><b>[[trait/73|Flourish]]</b>:
            Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.
            You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. <br/><br/>[[trait/123|Open]]: These maneuvers
            work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action with the open trait
            only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn. <br/><br/><b>[[trait/133|Press]]</b>:
            Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used
            only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not
            your turn, even if you use the [[action/82|Ready]] activity.<br/><br/> Some actions with the press trait
            also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical
            failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example,
            you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)</div>
